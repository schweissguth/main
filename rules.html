        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each week, every player selects <strong>two drivers</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>Only <strong>one</strong> of the two drivers may be ranked inside the <strong>Top 10</strong> in points.</li>
                    <li>A player <strong>cannot</strong> select a driver already chosen by another player that week, for that group.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>After the race, points are awarded based on how each selected driver finishes relative to all other picked drivers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Highest‑finishing selected driver → <strong>16 points</strong></li>
                    <li>Lowest‑finishing selected driver → <strong>1 point</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Bonus points</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Finish highest within your group (A or B) → <strong>+1 point</strong></li>
                    <li>Your driver wins the race → <strong>+2 points</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Maximum possible weekly score:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>34 points</strong> (16 + 15 + 2 + 1)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>After scoring is complete, everything resets for the next race:
                <ul>
                    <li>Players are randomly placed into <strong>Group A</strong> or <strong>Group B</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>A weekly <strong>pick order</strong> is created for each group based on last week’s performance:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lowest‑scoring player picks first; highest‑scoring player picks last.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Players pick drivers in order until both selections are made.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How to Win</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After all <strong>36 regular‑season</strong> races, the player with the most total points is the <strong>Regular Season Champion</strong>.</li>
            <li>During the <strong>10‑race Chase</strong>, the player with the most Chase points is the <strong>Chase Champion</strong>.</li>

        <h2>Rules</h2>

            <li>If a player forgets to pick or delays the group, they will be assigned the <strong>minimum points</strong> for both drivers (1 and 2 points).</li>
            <li>If a driver is missing from the list, contact an admin to have it added.</li>
            <li>If mid‑week standings changes cause a player to have two Top‑10 drivers, they are <strong>not required</strong> to change their picks.</li>
